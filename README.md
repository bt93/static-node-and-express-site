# Static Node.js and Express site
Sixth project for the Treehouse Full-Stack JavaScript Techdegree. Portfolio site to showcase the projects I've built in the Techdegree. The site contains a modern landing page, an about page, and a series of project pages to show off and detail the first five projects from this Techdegree.

## Uses
